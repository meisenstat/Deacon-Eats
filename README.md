# Deacon-Eats

This is a semester project for CSC 331 Software Engineering at Wake Forest.

The idea of our project was to build out an UberEats type of app for students to use on campus for food pickup and delivery. This was built by 5 students all listed on the repo.

We used Swift to build our app and Google Firebase as our database. We did not run a dedicated backend since Swift and Firebase work well together.

The UI is minimal and the app is missing some features but that is because our professor did not give students adequate time to work on their projects since it was assigned late and we were given lots of busy work.
